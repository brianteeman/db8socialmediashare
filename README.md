##db8 Social Media Share (for Joomla 3.x)

Most Social Media extensions had too much options for me. 
Some of them download JavaScript from external sites and call back to social media sites to show 
how many of your friends have shared / liked the page.
Besides of a performance decrease because of the loading, it can also cause privacy issues. 
Therefore I created a small social media share module with only the functionality that I needed. 

### Share button only
This Module displays Icons with hyperlinks to make it easier to share the page via Social Media.
It does not use JavaScript, nor does it communicate any information to the social media websites if 
the buttons are NOT clicked. 

When a visitor clicks on one of the buttons, it opens a small window from that social media. 
The visitor can change the text and link to your page, and share it with their friends. 

### Easy configuration
In the back-end of the Module you can configure the order of the buttons and visibility (to make an icon invisible, 
set order to "0"). 

### Image icons or CSS icons
You can choose between Image icons that are optimized for accessibility or CSS icons. When you choose CSS icons, 
you can load the default CSS, or choose to add the CSS to your own template CSS (for better performance).
