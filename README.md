db8 Social Media Share for Joomla 3.4

Most Social Media extensions had too much options for me. 
Some of them download JavaScript from external sites to show how many of your friends have shared the page.
Besides of a performance decrease because of the loading, it can also cause privacy issues.

Therefore I created a small social media share module with only the functionality that I needed. 

You can configure the order of the buttons and visibility (order "0" = invisible). When a visitor clicks on one of the buttons, it opens a small window where the visitor can change the text with link to your page. It does not use JavaScript, nor does it communicate any information to the social media websites if the buttons are not clicked.

Version 1.6.0
Conditional loading CSS + "Fontawesome" Alternative Layout

Version 1.3
Fixed <updateserver> for automatic future update notifications & one-click-update functionality

Version 1.2 
Added information screen to Module back-end with links to documentation and github.

Version 1.1 
Has 6 icons for Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Google+, Email and Pinterest.
The icon images have been replaced with icomoon icons made with http://icomoon.io/app/

Version 1.0
Has 4 image icons for Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Google+.
